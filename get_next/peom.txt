THE SHINE ON HER BUCKLE TOOK PRECEDENCE IN SUN
HER SHINE, I SHOULD SAY, COULD TAKE ME ANYWHERE
IT FEELS RIGHT TO BE UP THIS CLOSE IN TIGHT WIND
IT FEELS RIGHT TO NOTICE ALL THE SHINY THINGS ABOUT YOU
ABOUT YOU THERE IS NOTHING I WOULDNâ€™T WANT TO KNOW
WITH YOU NOTHING IS SIMPLE YET NOTHING IS SIMPLER
ABOUT YOU MANY GOOD THINGS COME INTO RELATION
